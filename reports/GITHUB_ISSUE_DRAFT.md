## Problem Description
Current data tables generated by TableCrafter are not fully accessible to screen readers and keyboard-only users.
- **Missing Scope:** Table headers (`<th>`) lack `scope="col"`.
- **Keyboard Trap:** Sorting headers are only clickable via mouse.
- **Unlabeled Inputs:** The Global Search input lacks an `aria-label`.
- **Mobile Access:** The mobile card view lacks semantic structure (`list` roles).

## Business Impact
This limits the plugin's adoption in government and enterprise sectors where WCAG compliance is mandatory.

## Proposed Solution
1.  Add `scope="col"` to all header rendering logic.
2.  Implement `aria-sort` logic (ascending/descending/none).
3.  Add `keydown` listeners to headers (Enter/Space to sort).
4.  Add `aria-label="Search table"` to search input.
5.  Add `role="list"` and `role="listitem"` to mobile views.

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] All table headers have `scope`.
- [ ] Sortable headers announce state changes to screen readers.
- [ ] Users can sort using keyboard.
- [ ] Mobile view passes accessibility audit tools.
