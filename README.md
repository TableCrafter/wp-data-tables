### 🛠️ Advanced Usage & Shortcuts

The `[tablecrafter]` shortcode is your control center:

*   **`source`**: The JSON endpoint you want to visualize.
*   **`include`**: Limit columns to a specific set (e.g., `include="name,price"`).
*   **`exclude`**: Hide sensitive or redundant fields (e.g., `exclude="id,metadata"`).
*   **`id`**: Apply a custom CSS ID for bespoke styling.

**Example: A Curated Crypto Table**
```text
[tablecrafter source="https://api.coingecko.com/..." include="symbol,current_price,price_change_24h"]
```
