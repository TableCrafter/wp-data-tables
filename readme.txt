== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this work with Elementor? =
YES! TableCrafter features the **ONLY true live preview** for Elementor users. Unlike other table plugins, you can see your actual data while designing in the Elementor editor - no more preview/publish cycles! Add the "TableCrafter Data Table" widget and enjoy WYSIWYG table editing with real-time data preview, feature indicators, and performance optimization.

= Do you offer Gravity Form Integration? =
Yes! We have a dedicated premium solution called **Advanced Data Tables for Gravity Forms** (formerly Gravity Tables). It adds frontend editing, advanced filtering, and bulk operations to your Gravity Forms entries.

= Does this store data in my WordPress database? =
No. TableCrafter is a lightweight viewer. It fetches data dynamically and caches it temporarily (SWR) to keep your database clean and your site fast.

= How does the SWR caching work? =
TableCrafter serves "stale" (cached) data instantly while refreshing the source in the background. This ensures your tables load in milliseconds without waiting for slow third-party APIs.

= Is it secure? =
Yes. We implement SSRF protection to prevent access to internal networks and use strict WordPress capability checks for all proxy operations.

= Can I use this for password-protected APIs? =
The free version is designed for public or key-based APIs (where the key is in the URL). For advanced OAuth or header-based authentication, please check out the Pro version or contact us for a custom solution.

= How often does the data refresh? =
TableCrafter supports two refresh methods:
1. **Auto-Refresh**: Set `auto_refresh="true"` with custom intervals (e.g., `refresh_interval="60000"` for 1 minute). Perfect for live dashboards and real-time data.
2. **Background Caching**: Uses Stale-While-Revalidate (SWR) caching to serve cached data instantly while refreshing from the source in the background.

= Is it possible to customize the table styling? =
Absolutely! TableCrafter uses standard HTML table structures. You can add your own CSS to your theme to override any styles. We also use CSS variables for many common properties like colors and padding.

= What if my API has CORS issues? =
TableCrafter includes a built-in Server-Side Proxy. When you use a remote URL as a source, the data is fetched by your server first, which completely bypasses any browser-based CORS restrictions.

= Do you offer custom development? =
Yes! If you need specific features, deep integrations, or custom designs, I am available for hire. Please contact me at **[info@fahdmurtaza.com](mailto:info@fahdmurtaza.com)** to discuss your project.
