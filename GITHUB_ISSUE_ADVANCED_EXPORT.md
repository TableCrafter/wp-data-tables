**Labels:** `enhancement`, `enterprise`, `export`, `business-critical`

## Problem Statement

TableCrafter currently has extremely basic export functionality that prevents enterprise adoption. The plugin only supports basic CSV export with no formatting, professional presentation, or business features that customers require for reports and compliance.

### Customer Pain Points
- "Can't export to Excel for our financial reports"
- "Need PDF exports with our company branding" 
- "CSV export doesn't meet our presentation standards"

### Technical Issues
- CSV-only export format
- No professional formatting or styling
- Missing business features (custom headers, logos, branding)
- Poor user experience with single export button
- No enterprise features for compliance and reporting

## Solution Overview

Implement comprehensive advanced export functionality with:

1. **Multi-Format Support:** CSV, Excel (.xls), and PDF exports
2. **Professional Formatting:** Styled headers, number formatting, custom branding
3. **Enterprise Features:** Custom headers/footers, company logos, metadata
4. **Enhanced UX:** Professional dropdown interface with format selection
5. **Security:** XSS-prevention with HTML escaping for business environments
